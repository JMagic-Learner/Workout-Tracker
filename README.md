## Description
Hello, my name is Jason Ma. This application is called Workout Tracker.
              
Description:
This application helps track and record your workout regimen. As a user, you can build your own workout plan with the help of MongoDB.              
          
Coding Process
First, I had to test if the local database even registered. I used Mongosh to verify the database / collection. Next I had to test out if the database was even being called by the application. The front end of the application was already provided by UWBOOTCAMP. Our task is to complete the backend MODELS, ROUTES etc. Initially, I had a problem where the local database had the code seeded, but the routes were missing their calls/fetches. I went to RYAN TA to help explain my application deficiencies. The source of the problem was the ROUTES folder, or more specifically on how the API/WORKOUTS etc were being called. Since i already had a index file detailing where the routes are to be redirected, the indvidivudal GET/ POST /PUT commands had the wrong syntax. Instead of /api/workouts/range, it was supposed to be /workouts/range. Overall this assignment was difficult in a way due to the fact that as a coder, i was stepping into a application with functionalities unknown to me. Half the battle was deciphering which JS file in assets did what.
